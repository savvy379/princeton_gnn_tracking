# GNNs Algorithms for Tracklet Finding in Pixel Detectors at the HL-LHC

## Overview
This repository implements multiple Graph Neural Network architectures designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of [particle track finding](https://indico.cern.ch/event/96989/contributions/2124495/attachments/1114189/1589705/WellsTracking.pdf) in pixel detectors (such as those in the [CMS](https://home.fnal.gov/~souvik/CMSPixels/index.html) and [ATLAS](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C020909/mgspaper.pdf) experiments) for the [High Luminosity LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/high-luminosity-lhc). For more information on tracking at the HL-LHC please see [1] - [3]. This project is supported by the [Insititue for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org/) and maintained by [Savannah Thais](https://github.com/savvy379) and [Gage DeZoort](https://github.com/GageDeZoort). We work closely with the [ExaTrkX project](https://github.com/exatrkx) and Mark Neubauer's [group](https://github.com/Neubauer-Group) at UIUC.
